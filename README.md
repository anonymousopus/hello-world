(Background Info)
I'm just another searcher with a degree (sociology) from outside the dev world. In the 80s my first computer was an Apple IIe with two floppy drives and a modem that you would put your home (landline) phone receiver into. My teen years were riddled with mischief--these events resulted  with my IT for life (MIS/SSA) Dad giving me "punishments" in DOS..."you're grounded until you can figure out how to use DOS to program the computer to print out 'I will not lie to my Grandmother' one-thousand times....In the pre-windows, CMD line world of black & green.

I originally made this account thinking it would be for my 8 year-old son--how cool would it be for him to have a repository of code he has written that could span throughout his lifetime. Then I realized that I have been googling my life away thinking about all of the things I can just learn how to do--- I could set up a VPN, how to make mods in minecraft, how does backend programming work because the idea of personal security and privacy often bubble up and penetration testing sounds kind of fun--you can do what with a USB?--open world game development is not only accessible but absolutely achievable--and lets not forget end of days--when AI begins to end humanity, computer language/process is going to be essential for survival...so there's that.  

One day for S&G's I just decided to try and I started dabbling with freecodecamp--and I admitted to myself that I enjoy tedious detail oriented and constantly changing scenarios that require adaptability and mental stamina.  A mobius loop of perpetuating outcomes--I just really want to see what I am capable of learning and doing--who knows what will unfold... I know that I am interested in too much--so I just started from the beginning with front end web dev and I am hoping that it paves a decent path to something that really grabs me.

I also like the idea of server side (I think) big open responsive world game design--interaction with the world environment that would evolve, fluctuate, and have a chain of event effect (when I do x it increases the chances of w-y happening-but at the same time its randomized because shit happens--IDK). 

(game idea)
I loved choose your own adventures as a kid-it was THE ONLY fiction I would read. I also loved playing this old game called Adventure. My Dad brought it home one day, and said one of his developers was working on it. I have to recreate this--or something like this, I loved it so much--even though I never beat it, and it was very difficult for me as a kid.
Adventure has the player's character explore a mysterious cave that is rumored to be filled with treasure and gold. To explore the cave, the player types in one- or two-word commands to move their character through the cave, interact with objects in the cave, pick up items to put into their inventory, and other actions. 

The program acts as a narrator, describing to the player what each location in the cave has, the results of certain actions, or if it did not understand the player's commands, asking for the player to retype their actions. The program's replies were typically in a humorous, conversational tone, much as a dungeon master would use in leading players in a tabletop role-playing game. A notable example is when the player dies after falling into a pit (player's commands in lower case, and the program's reply in all-capitals):

YOU ARE STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A SMALL BRICK BUILDING.
AROUND YOU IS A FOREST.  A SMALL STREAM FLOWS OUT OF THE BUILDING AND
DOWN A GULLY.

>go south

YOU ARE IN A VALLEY IN THE FOREST BESIDE A STREAM TUMBLING ALONG A    
ROCKY BED.


>go west

YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY!

NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!  I'M OUT OF ORANGE SMOKE!  YOU DON'T EXPECT
ME TO DO A DECENT REINCARNATION WITHOUT ANY ORANGE SMOKE, DO YOU?

>yes

OKAY, IF YOU'RE SO SMART, DO IT YOURSELF!  I'M LEAVING!

Certain actions may cause the death of the character (player has three lives), requiring the player to start again. The game has a point system, whereby completing certain goals earns a number of predetermined points. The ultimate goal waws to earn the maximum number of points (350 points), which partially correlates to finding all the treasures in the game and safely leaving the cave.
